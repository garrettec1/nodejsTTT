This text file is for organizing my thoughts.
* Getting started
** Initial Goal
   - Make the game playable by two human players
   - Needs
     1. A board object
     2. A player object
     3. A game loop

** Board object
   - The most logical place to start working on a TTT game is the board.
   - Start by making the board display
     - Board object responds to display message, or always displays?
   - I am going to make it an object that responds to move messages.
     1. (some move)
        - From game, or player?
     2. returns
        - updated board
        - is move legal?
        - winning move?
