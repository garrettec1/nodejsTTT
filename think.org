This text file is for organizing my thoughts.
* Getting started
** Initial Goal
   - Make the game playable by two human players
   - Needs
     1. A board object
     2. A player object
     3. A game loop

** Board object
   - The most logical place to start working on a TTT game is the board.
   - Start by making the board display
     - Board object responds to display message, or always displays?
   - I am going to make it an object that responds to move messages.
     1. (some move)
        - From game, or player?
     2. returns
        - updated board
        - is move legal?
        - winning move?
*** data structure
   - The display of the board is intimately related to how I am going to store
     and the state of the game pieces.
**** dictionary/map
     - Previously I have done this by using a dictionary (map) and format
       strings to get the game pieces displayed properly. Let's see if I can think
       of another way.
     - The convenience of this was that the board location was also the key value.
     - Since any function in the game could access this, it simplified the
       interface.
**** All encompesing array
     - I could make an array that held the board state and the disply
     - do something like var array = ['X', '|' , ' ', '|', 'O', '\n] ...
       then build a string out of it.
     - I don't think this is a good idea because it marries the display and the
       data in a gnarly way. Also hard to read.
**** Bisectional array.
     - Use a simple array to hold board state initialized with ' ' in each index.
     - Math to access.
       * coordinates denote shifts in index.
       * '1a'
       * the first int adds index like this index = (coord - 1)*3 and so on
       * the string index (if a -> index +0) (if b -> index +1) and so on
     - How to print board in this case?
     - how about something like console.log(" ", array(0), " | ", array(1)...
       and so on.
